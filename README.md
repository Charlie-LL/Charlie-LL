## Hi there 👋

# Execution-Focused Crypto Systems

I build trading infrastructure designed around market microstructure, execution quality, and risk-aware system architecture.

My current focus is developing modular execution frameworks that emphasize:

- Real-time market perception  
- State-driven decision engines  
- Pre-trade risk enforcement  
- Permission-based execution control  
- Latency-aware design  

The objective is simple:

> Build systems that survive real markets.

## Current Direction

Most trading discussions revolve around alpha.

I focus on **whether alpha can actually be executed**.

Areas of active exploration:

- Crypto market microstructure  
- Execution system design  
- Liquidity-aware trading behavior  
- Risk gating and kill-switch architecture  
- Smart order routing concepts  
- Trading system observability

## Selected Work

### Crypto Execution Lab  
Designing a modular execution environment structured around perception → state → risk → decision.

Emphasis is placed on system reliability rather than strategy experimentation.

## Engineering Philosophy

Trading systems should not behave like scripts.

They should behave like controlled machines operating under uncertainty.

Key principles:

- Deterministic behavior beats reactive improvisation  
- Risk should be enforced before exposure  
- Speed protects more capital than prediction  
- Liquidity is a constraint, not a suggestion  

---

## Long-Term Goal

To contribute to professional trading environments where execution quality, infrastructure resilience, and risk discipline are treated as first-class concerns.
